abstract = {In this work we explore a correspondence between quantum circuits and low-degree polynomials over the finite field . Any quantum circuit made up of Hadamard, Z, controlled-Z and controlled-controlled-Z gates gives rise to a degree-3 polynomial over  such that calculating quantum circuit amplitudes is equivalent to counting zeroes of the corresponding polynomial. We exploit this connection, which is especially clean and simple for this particular gate set, in two directions. First, we give proofs of classical hardness results based on quantum circuit concepts. Second, we find efficient classical simulation algorithms for certain classes of quantum circuits based on efficient algorithms for classes of polynomials.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the second-order Reed–Muller (RM) code R (2, m), which is a union of cosets of the first-order RM code R (l, m), and these cosets are in 1-1 correspondence with symplectic forms. The rank of the matrix is called the rank of the symplectic form, or of the coset, and uniquely determines the weight distribution of the coset. The chapter counts symplectic forms by rank, and hence finds the weight distribution of R (2, m). The weight distribution of certain interesting small subcodes of R (2, m), including the dual of the double-error-correcting BCH code are obtained. The maximal sets of symplectic forms with the property that the rank of the sum of any two forms in the set is ≥ 2 d is built. The corresponding subcodes of R(2, m) have several interesting properties. These subcodes are linear if m is odd; however for even m they are the nonlinear generalised Kerdock codes DG(m, d).}

abstract = {Due to the significant progress made in the implementation of quantum hardware, efficient methods and tools to design corresponding algorithms become increasingly important. Many of these tools rely on functional representations of certain building blocks or even entire quantum algorithms which, however, inherently exhibit an exponential complexity. Although several alternative representations have been proposed to cope with this complexity, the construction of those representations remains a bottleneck. In this work, we propose solutions for efficiently constructing representations of quantum functionality based on the idea of conducting as many operations as possible on as small as possible intermediate representations—using Decision Diagrams as a representative functional description. Experimental evaluations show that applying these solutions allows to construct the desired representations several factors faster than with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, if repeating structures (which frequently occur in quantum algorithms) are explicitly exploited, exponential improvements are possible—allowing to construct the functionality of certain algorithms within seconds, whereas the state of the art fails to construct it in an entire day.},
