This contains the results of `demo.ipynb` which one can try with different values of `h` and `n`. 

The results are in append mode in `program_data_h.csv`, so look at the last line for your output results. 

`circuits` directory stores all the random circuits which are simulated  in qasm2 and qasm3 format. The name of the circuit file contains `n`, `h` and `h_prob` with it's type. Inside each circuit file, the seed used to generate the random circuit is also saved.
